# TicketLite
A highly lightweight system for inputting a customers order number on one interface which then displays on a second display. Perfect for informing customers that their take-away is ready.

![Windowed example.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shardj/TicketLite/master/example.gif)


You will require:

* Python3.

* pip. For the next step.

* tkinter. `pip install tkinter` or `python3 pip install tkinter` or whichever command your system uses with pip.

More obsucure usage:

* Inputting a comma has the same affect as clicking the remove last number button

* Pressing escape while on the output screen toggles fullscreen

* Font details are easily changed from the top of main.py
